# Caravans

Caravans are a group of entities that will come to a player, trade with them and then vanish into the distance.

Caravans currently does not have any default trades and will not spawn any caravans, instead it is all must be registered through a zenscript file in configs/caravans/<script>.zs

This requires CraftTweaker to be installed.
Information on how to add content through CraftTweaker can be found [here](https://github.com/primetoxinz/Caravans/wiki)
